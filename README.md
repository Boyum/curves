| A11Y | By following W3C's [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), all users' are able to enjoy the content of this application. |
| AngularJS | [Google's AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a great framework for making web applications. This project makes use of the framework's ngRoute to create a Single Page Application. |
| High Performance | By in-lining critical styles, and load the rest asynchronously with `rel="preload"` or the Filament Group's [LoadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) [(depending on the user's browser)](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS), small bits of the page shows up almost immediately on most connections. | 
| Responsive Design | By using [Twitter Bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/) grid system we ensure usability on all different sizes. |
| RESTful API | A lightning fast REST API makes the application load quickly, and creates a very low binding between back-end and front-end. |
